# Google Sheets

A repo storing all the Google Sheets related stuff. Currently, it is mainly used for the homepage ticker.

## Folders

`server/`: Deta Micro stuff (in Python)

`demo/`: Demo website (hosted on GH Pages)

`apps-script/`: Holds the Google Apps script that runs on the google sheets

## Web View

You can check the status of the server by going to the Deta Web view here:

[https://web.deta.sh/home/eccc-summer-student/sheets-api/](https://web.deta.sh/home/eccc-summer-student/sheets-api/micros).

The login credentials are on the credentials document, and should also be saved on the CanadaSummerWorker google account.

Note that the project is called `sheets-api`; there's another project called `homepage-ticker`, but that one is old and deprecated. Deta doesn't allow us to delete projects yet so we just have to keep it there for now.
